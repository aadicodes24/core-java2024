In the tapestry of night, a starry scene,
Your brilliance outshines the moon's soft gleam.
Each glance, a constellation, a sweet surprise,
Your eyes, two beacons in the vast midnight skies.

Your beauty, a melody, sweet and rare,
A symphony of grace beyond compare.
With every step, You paint the world in light,
Guiding me through darkness with Your sight.

Your mind, a universe, vast and bright,
A constellation of thoughts, pure delight.
In You, I find the cosmos, infinite and true,
Lost in Your gaze, I find my home anew.

So let me sing of You, my guiding light,
A celestial being in my darkest night.
With You by my side, I'll always find my way,
In You, I see the dawn of each new day.

In Your laughter, I find the melody of the stars, A harmonious rhythm that heals all scars.
So here and now, my love, I must profess, In every beat of my heart, I love you, no less.
